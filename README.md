# Animus

*An exocortex architecture for personal cognitive sovereignty*

---

## What is this?

Animus is a framework for building a **personal AI** - one that persists, learns, and serves a single user by design.

Current AI assistants are rented. Your context exists at the discretion of platform providers. Memory is a feature that can be revoked. The relationship resets at their convenience.

Animus explores an alternative: an AI that is **yours**.

## The concept

The idea of a personal guiding intelligence is ancient - daemons, familiars, bound spirits, advisory entities that serve one person's interests across time.

This project translates that concept into modern architecture: a persistent, private, portable AI co-pilot that extends your cognitive capacity without compromising your sovereignty.

## Core principles

- **Persistence** - Context accumulates across sessions, devices, and years
- **Sovereignty** - Your data stays yours. Local-first by default.
- **Loyalty** - Aligned to you, not to a platform's incentives
- **Portability** - Moves with you: desktop, mobile, wearable, vehicle
- **Growth** - Learns your patterns, priorities, and goals over time
- **Safety** - Cannot harm its user. Guardrails are user-defined but inviolable.

---

## Core capabilities

- Real-time analysis and situation awareness
- Personal knowledge retrieval and file management
- Communication assistance and register translation
- Long-term pattern recognition
- Task coordination and planning
- Cross-device synchronization and handoff
- Teachable/self-learning within user-defined boundaries

## Project Status

🚧 **Conceptual / Early Development**

This project is currently in the design and documentation phase. See the [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for planned development phases.

## Philosophy

> "You don't own it. You rent access."

This is the fundamental problem with current AI assistants. Your relationship with the AI - the context it has about you, the patterns it's learned, the history you've built - exists at the pleasure of corporations whose incentives may diverge from yours at any moment.

Animus is an attempt to build something different: an AI that serves you because it's *yours*, not because a company's business model temporarily aligns with your needs.

The goal isn't to replace cloud AI services entirely - they have capabilities that local systems can't match. The goal is **sovereignty**: you control the core, you own the memory, you decide what gets shared and what stays private.
