# Animus Bootstrap

**Your personal AI — sovereign, persistent, and self-improving.**

```bash
pip install animus-bootstrap && animus-bootstrap install
```

That single command installs dependencies, runs the onboarding wizard, registers a system service, and opens the dashboard. First-run to working system in under 5 minutes.

## Architecture

```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|  animus-bootstrap install (daemon)                   |
|  One-command bootstrap. Installs deps, registers     |
|  system service, manages config, checks updates.     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|  animus-bootstrap setup (onboarding wizard)          |
|  Interactive first-run. API keys, identity,          |
|  Forge connection, device/memory config.             |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|  animus-bootstrap dashboard (local web UI)           |
|  Status, health, config management, identity         |
|  editor, proposal approval gate. localhost:7700      |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|  animus-bootstrap reflect (self-improvement loop)    |
|  Daily summarization -> LEARNED.md. Proposes         |
|  identity changes. Waits for your approval.          |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

## Quickstart

1. **Install:** `pip install animus-bootstrap`
2. **Run:** `animus-bootstrap install`
3. **Wizard completes:** API keys, identity, memory backend
4. **Dashboard opens:** `http://localhost:7700`
5. **Done.** Animus is running as a system service.

## Identity Files

Animus stores your personality and preferences in six markdown files at
`~/.config/animus/identity/`:

| File | Purpose | Who Writes |
|------|---------|------------|
| `CORE_VALUES.md` | Immutable foundation — sovereignty, honesty, loyalty, excellence | You (wizard) |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Who you are — name, role, background | You + Animus |
| `CONTEXT.md` | Current projects, priorities, what's top of mind | You + Animus |
| `PREFERENCES.md` | Tone, format, response style | You + Animus |
| `LEARNED.md` | What Animus has learned about you | Animus (reflection loop) |
| `GOALS.md` | Short and long term goals | You |

### Why CORE_VALUES.md is Locked

`CORE_VALUES.md` is the drift prevention anchor. Animus **cannot** modify this
file — not through the write tool, not through proposals, not through reflection.
It can only be edited manually or via `animus-bootstrap setup --reset-values`.

This ensures Animus's core behavior never silently shifts. If something feels
off, reset your values and everything downstream recalibrates.

---

## Self-Improvement

Animus improves through four mechanisms:

### Reflection Loop
Every 24 hours (configurable), Animus reviews recent interactions, identifies
patterns and preferences, and appends new learnings to `LEARNED.md`.

### Write Tool
During conversation, Animus can update identity files when it observes clear
preferences. Small changes (< 20% of file size) are written directly.

### Proposal System
Changes exceeding 20% of a file go through the approval gate. Each proposal
shows a diff, explains the reasoning, and waits for you to approve or reject
in the dashboard.

### Feedback Signal
Thumbs up/down on interactions in the memory browser feed into the reflection
loop, reinforcing what works and flagging what doesn't.

---

## Philosophy

### Sovereignty
Your data stays on your machine. No telemetry by default. No cloud sync.
Single-user by design. Works fully offline after install.

### Persistence
Animus remembers every interaction via ChromaDB vector memory.
Identity files accumulate context over time. Nothing is forgotten
unless you delete it.

### Loyalty
Animus serves your long-term interests, not your momentary preferences.
It will push back when warranted. Core values cannot be overridden.

### Self-Improvement
Animus reflects on interactions, proposes changes to its own behavior,
and waits for your approval. The human stays in the loop.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **1a — Talk** | Local LLM, identity, memory, dashboard | Complete |
| **1b — Learn** | Reflection loop, proposals, feedback | Complete |
| **2 — Act** | Forge integration (orchestration engine) | Planned |
| **3 — Scale** | Quorum coordination (multi-agent) | Planned |

Forge appears as a status card in the dashboard now. Full integration in Phase 2.

## Relationship to Animus Ecosystem

- **Animus Core** — The exocortex engine (identity, memory, CLI)
- **Animus Forge** — Multi-agent orchestration engine (connects at wizard Step 4)
- **Animus Quorum** — Coordination protocol (coming in Phase 3)
- **Animus Bootstrap** — This package. The install/setup/dashboard layer.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AreteDriver/Animus.git
cd Animus/packages/bootstrap
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
ruff check src/ tests/ && ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

1403 tests, 94% coverage, Python 3.11+.

---

## Status

**Alpha** — Not ready for production use. API keys are file-permission protected but the system is under active development.
