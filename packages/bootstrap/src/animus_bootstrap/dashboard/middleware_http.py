"""Default-deny bearer-auth middleware for the dashboard.

A remote (non-local) client must present a valid bearer token for EVERY
route except a small public allowlist (static assets + the bare liveness
probe). Local clients (loopback) are exempt, keeping the on-box HTMX
dashboard frictionless.

This is default-DENY by client locality, NOT an allowlist of "/api" paths.
The earlier design gated only the ``/api`` prefix, which left the most
dangerous endpoints — all served on BARE paths (``/tools/execute``,
``/config``, ``/memory/export``, ``/self-mod``, ``/update/apply``,
``/proposals/*``) — completely unauthenticated for any remote client once
the box was bound for remote access. Locality, not URL shape, is the trust
boundary, so the token is required across the whole surface.

The active configuration is read from ``request.app.state.config`` at
dispatch time so a token generated during ``serve()`` is picked up without
rebuilding the middleware stack.
