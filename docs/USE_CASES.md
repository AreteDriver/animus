# Use Cases

Real-world scenarios where Animus provides value. These aren't hypothetical - they're the problems this project aims to solve.

---

## Daily Life

### Morning Briefing

**Scenario:** You wake up, say "Good morning" to Animus.

**Response:**
- Weather and how it affects your day
- Calendar overview with travel time calculations
- Unread messages that need attention (prioritized)
- Reminders for things you told it to remind you about
- Any overnight developments on topics you're tracking

**Why it matters:** You don't start the day by checking five apps. You start informed.

---

### Real-Time Meeting Support

**Scenario:** You're in a meeting, someone references a project from three months ago.

**Interaction:** Quick voice query or glance at wearable: "What was the outcome of the Q3 planning session?"

**Response:** Brief summary of decisions made, who was responsible for what, current status.

**Why it matters:** You never look unprepared. Your memory extends beyond your brain.

---

### Communication Drafting

**Scenario:** You need to send a difficult email - maybe pushing back on a request or negotiating.

**Interaction:** "Help me draft a response to [person] about [topic]. I want to be firm but not burn bridges."

**Response:** Draft in your voice, with your communication style, aware of your relationship history with this person.

**Why it matters:** The AI knows how you write, what your goals are, and can help you communicate more effectively than you could alone under time pressure.

---

### Register Translation

**Scenario:** You need to explain a technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder. Or translate corporate-speak into plain language.

**Interaction:** "How would I explain [concept] to [audience]?"

**Response:** Translation that accounts for the audience's background, your relationship with them, and the context.

**Why it matters:** Communication failures are often translation failures. Animus bridges that gap.

## Professional Work

### Situation Analysis

**Scenario:** You're about to walk into a negotiation, interview, or important meeting.

**Interaction:** "Brief me on [company/person/topic]."

**Response:**
- Relevant background information
- Recent news or developments
- Your previous interactions with them (if any)
- Potential talking points or concerns
- Questions you might want to ask

**Why it matters:** You walk in prepared, with context you couldn't have assembled manually in the time available.

---

### Decision Support

**Scenario:** You're facing a complex decision with multiple factors.

**Interaction:** "Help me think through [decision]. Here are the factors..."

**Response:**
- Structured analysis of options
- Factors you might have missed (based on knowing your priorities)
- Historical context: "Last time you faced something similar, you chose X and the outcome was Y"
- Questions to help clarify your thinking

**Why it matters:** Not deciding for you - helping you decide better.

---

### Pattern Recognition

**Scenario:** You're trying to understand why something keeps happening - a recurring problem at work, a pattern in your life.

**Interaction:** "I keep running into [problem]. What patterns do you see?"

**Response:** Analysis based on accumulated context - conversations, decisions, outcomes over time.

**Why it matters:** Animus has a longitudinal view of your life that you can't maintain consciously.

---

### Project Continuity

**Scenario:** You're picking up a project after a break - vacation, other priorities, or just time passing.

**Interaction:** "Where did I leave off with [project]?"

**Response:**
- Last state of work
- Outstanding tasks
- Decisions that were pending
- Context you'll need to resume effectively

**Why it matters:** No more "what was I thinking?" when you return to something.

**Interaction:** "What's [child]'s schedule this week?" or "When is [child]'s next doctor appointment?"

**Response:** Relevant information, conflicts, logistics.

## Anti-Patterns (What Animus Doesn't Do)

### Not a Replacement for Human Connection

Animus is a tool, not a friend. It can help you communicate better with humans, but it shouldn't become a substitute for human relationships.

### Not a Decision Maker

Animus supports decisions, it doesn't make them for you. The goal is augmented intelligence, not delegated judgment.

### Not Surveillance

Animus knows what you tell it and what you give it access to. It doesn't watch you, track you without consent, or infer things you haven't shared.

### Not an Attention Trap

Designed for minimal interaction, maximum utility. The goal is to help you live your life, not to keep you engaged with the AI.

## Measuring Success

For each use case, ask:

1. **Did it save time?** - Faster than doing it yourself
2. **Did it improve quality?** - Better outcome than you'd achieve alone
3. **Did it reduce friction?** - Easier than the alternative
4. **Did it respect autonomy?** - You remained in control
5. **Did it feel right?** - Not creepy, not overreaching

If the answer to all five is yes, the use case is working.
