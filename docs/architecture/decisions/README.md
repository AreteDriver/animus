## What is an ADR?

An **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** documents a significant decision: the context, the options considered, the choice made, and the tradeoffs accepted. ADRs are append-only — once logged, they are not edited, only superseded by a new ADR.

An **Arete Decision Log (ADL)** entry is a higher-level commitment scoped to a project milestone. ADLs live here alongside ADRs.
