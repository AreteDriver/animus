# Case Study: Animus

*Personal AI Framework for Cognitive Sovereignty*

---

## Executive Summary

Animus is an open-source framework for building a **personal AI** — one that persists, learns, and serves a single user by design. Unlike cloud AI assistants that forget everything between sessions, Animus implements a local-first exocortex with persistent memory, cross-device sync, and guardrailed self-learning.

**By the numbers:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of code | 18,000+ |
| Tests | 333 across 10 files |
| Memory types | 4 (episodic, semantic, procedural, active) |
| Interfaces | 4 (CLI, API, voice, WebSocket sync) |
| Integrations | 7 (Ollama, Calendar, Gmail, Todoist, Whisper, ChromaDB, sync) |
| Development phases | 5 of 6 complete |

---

## The Problem

Current AI assistants are **rented, not owned**. They're stateless, cloud-dependent, and generic:

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **No memory** | Every conversation starts from zero |
| **No personalization** | Responses are generic, not adapted to you |
| **No sovereignty** | Your data lives on corporate servers, used for training |
| **No continuity** | Context doesn't follow you across devices |
| **No learning** | The AI never gets better at helping *you* specifically |
| **Vendor risk** | Terms of service can change; features can be revoked |

> "You don't own it. You rent access."

## The Solution

Animus inverts the model: **an AI that is yours**.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Persistent memory** — Four types matching human cognition: episodic (what happened), semantic (what you know), procedural (how you work), active (current context)
- **Local-first** — Ollama for inference, ChromaDB for storage, works offline
- **Cross-device sync** — WebSocket + Zeroconf for seamless context handoff
- **Voice interface** — Whisper STT + TTS for hands-free operation
- **Guardrailed learning** — Pattern detection bounded by immutable safety rules
- **Integrations** — Google Calendar, Gmail, Todoist via OAuth2

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Local-First by Design

**Decision:** All core functionality runs locally. Cloud AI is optional.

**Rationale:** Personal AI handles sensitive data — decisions, health, finances, relationships. Cloud dependency creates privacy risk and single point of failure. Local-first means:
- Works offline
- Data stays on-device
- No third party trains on your information
- No vendor can revoke access

### 2. Four Memory Types

**Decision:** Implement episodic, semantic, procedural, and active context as distinct systems.

**Rationale:** Human cognition uses different memory types for different purposes:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Episodic | What happened | "Last Tuesday you decided to use PostgreSQL" |
| Semantic | What you know | "User prefers concise responses" |
| Procedural | How you work | "Deploy process: test → stage → prod" |
| Active | Current session | "We're discussing the auth refactor" |

Conflating these into a single vector store loses the structure that makes retrieval useful.

### 3. Guardrailed Learning

**Decision:** Bound all learning with immutable safety rules.

**Rationale:** A personal AI that learns your patterns is powerful but dangerous without constraints:

```python
# Core guardrails (immutable)
- Cannot take actions that harm user
- Cannot exfiltrate data without consent
- Cannot modify its own guardrails
- All learning must be transparent
- All learning must be reversible
```

The three-tier system (immutable core → system defaults → user preferences) ensures learned behavior can never erode safety.

### 4. Phased Development

**Decision:** Build in six phases, each delivering a working system.

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Foundation — basic conversation + memory | ✅ Complete |
| 1 | Memory architecture — 4 memory types | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Cognitive capabilities — tools, analysis | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Multi-interface — voice + API + sync | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Integration — calendar, email, tasks | ✅ Complete |
| 5 | Self-learning — pattern detection, guardrails | ✅ Complete |
| 6 | Ambient — wearable, vehicle integration | 🔜 Future |

**Rationale:** Building the full vision at once would be a multi-year monolith. Each phase ships a complete, testable system. Feedback informs later design.

## Technical Implementation

### Memory System

ChromaDB stores vector embeddings for semantic search. Each memory entry is typed, timestamped, and tagged:

```python
memory.remember(
    content="User prefers concise responses",
    memory_type="semantic",
    tags=["preference", "communication"],
    confidence=0.9,
)

# Retrieval with type-weighted scoring
context = memory.recall("How should I communicate?", limit=5)
```

Episodic memories decay over time; semantic memories remain stable.

### Cross-Device Sync

WebSocket-based synchronization with Zeroconf for automatic discovery:

```
Device A ──────────────────────────────────────► Device B
          [memory delta, encrypted, signed]
```

- Eventual consistency with last-write-wins
- Device priority ordering for conflicts
- End-to-end encryption on all sync traffic

### Learning System

Pattern detection with explicit approval workflow:

```python
# Scan memories for patterns
patterns = learning.scan_and_learn()

# Review what was learned (transparency)
pending = learning.get_pending_learnings()

# Approve or reject
learning.approve(pending[0].id)

# Rollback if needed
learning.rollback.restore(checkpoint_id)
```

2. **Learning system** — Demonstrate pattern detection → approval → application flow
3. **Guardrails** — Show how immutable constraints prevent unsafe learned behavior
4. **Cross-device** — Sync context between two devices in real-time
5. **Voice mode** — Hands-free interaction with STT/TTS
